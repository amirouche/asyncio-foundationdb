## `import found`

### `found.BaseFoundException`

All `found` exceptions inherit that class.

### `found.FoundException`

Exception raised when there is an error foundationdb client driver, or
foundationdb server side.

### `await found.open(cluster_file=None)`

Open database.

Coroutine that will open a connection with the cluster specified in
the file `cluster_file`. If `cluster_file` is not provided the default
is `/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster`. Returns a database object.

### `await found.transactional(db, func, *args, snapshot=False, **kwargs)`

Operate a transaction for `func`.

Coroutine that will operate a transaction against `db` for `func`. If
`snapshot=True` then the transaction is read-only. `func` will receive
an appropriate transaction object as first argument, then `args`, then
`kwargs`. Because of errors `transactional` might run `func` several
times, hence `func` should be idempotent.

### `await found.get(tx, key)`

Get the value associated with `key`.

Coroutine that will fetch the value associated with `key` inside the
database associated with `tx`. `key` must be `bytes`. In case of
success, returns `bytes`. Otherwise, if there is no value associated
with `key`, returns the object `None`.

### `await found.set(tx, key, value)`

Set `key` to `value`.

In the database associated with `tx`, associate `key` with
`value`. Both `key` and `value` must be `bytes`.

### `found.pack(tuple)`

Serialize python objects `tuple` into bytes.

### `found.pack_with_versionstamp(tuple)`

Serialize python objects `tuple` into bytes. `tuple` may contain
`found.Versionstamp` objects.

### `found.unpack(bytes)`

Deserialize bytes into python objects.

### `found.Versionstamp(...)`

FIXME.

### `await found.clear(tx, key, other=None)`

Remove key or keys.

In the database associated with `tx`, clear the specified `key` or
range of keys.

`key` and `other` if provided must be `bytes`.

If `other=None`, then clear the association that might exists with
`key`. Otherwise, if `other` is provided, `found.clear` will remove
any association between `key` and `other` but not the association with
`other` if any (that is `other` is excluded from the range).

### `await found.query(tx, key, other, *, limit=0, mode=STREAMING_MODE_ITERATOR)`

Fetch key-value pairs.

In the database associated with `tx`, generate at most `limit`
key-value pairs inside the specified range, with the specified order.

If `key < other` then `found.query` generates key-value pairs in
lexicographic order. Otherwise, if `key > other` then `found.query`
generates key-value pairs in reverse lexicographic order, that is
starting at `other` until `key`.

If `limit=0`, then `found.query` generates all key-value pairs in the
specified bounds. Otherwise if `limit > 0` then, it generates at most
`limit` pairs.

The keyword `mode` can be one the following constant:

- `found.STREAMING_MODE_WANT_ALL`
- `found.STREAMING_MODE_ITERATOR`
- `found.STREAMING_MODE_EXACT`
- `found.STREAMING_MODE_SMALL`
- `found.STREAMING_MODE_MEDIUM`
- `found.STREAMING_MODE_LARGE`
- `found.STREAMING_MODE_SERIAL`

### `found.next_prefix(key)`

Returns the immediatly next byte sequence that is not prefix of `key`.

### `found.lt(key, offset=0)`

### `found.lte(key, offset=0)`

### `found.gt(key, offset=0)`

### `found.gte(key, offset=0)`

### `await found.read_version(tx)`

### `found.set_read_version(tx, version)`

### `found.add(tx, key, param)`

### `found.bit_and(tx, key, param)`

### `found.bit_or(tx, key, param)`

### `found.bit_xor(tx, key, param)`

### `found.max(tx, key, param)`

### `found.byte_max(tx, key, param)`

### `found.min(tx, key, param)`

### `found.byte_min(tx, key, param)`

### `found.set_versionstamped_key(tx, key, param)`

### `found.set_versionstamped_value(tx, key, param)`

## `from found import bstore`

### `bstore.BStoreException`

Exception specific to `bstore`.

### `bstore.make(name, prefix)`

Handle over a `bstore` called `name` with `prefix`.

### `await bstore.get_or_create(tx, bstore, blob)`

### `await bstore.get(tx, bstore, uid)`

## `from found import nstore`

### `nstore.NStoreException`

Exception specific to `nstore`.

### `nstore.make(name, prefix, n)`

Create a handle over a `nstore` called `name` with `prefix` and `n`
columns.

The argument `name` should be a string, it is really meant to ease
debugging. `prefix` should be a tuple that can be packed with
`found.pack`. Last but not least, `n` is the number of columns in the
returned tuple store (or, if you prefer, the number of tuple items).

It is preferable to store the returned value.

### `await nstore.add(tx, nstore, *items, *, value=b'')`

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `nstore`, add
`items` associated with `value`.

### `await nstore.remove(tx, nstore, *items)`

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `nstore`, remove
`items` and the associated value.

### `await nstore.get(tx, nstore, *items)`

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `nstore`, get the
value associated with `items`. If there is no such items in `nstore`,
returns `None`.

### `nstore.var(name)`

Create a variable called `name` for use with `nstore.query`.

### `await nstore.query(tx, nstore, pattern, *patterns)`

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `nstore`, generate
mappings that match `pattern` and `patterns`. Both `pattern` and
`patterns` may contain `nstore.var` that will be replaced with
matching values in the generic tuple store.

## `from found import eavstore`

### `eavstore.make(name, prefix)`

Create a handle over an eavstore called `name` with `prefix`.

The argument `name` should be a string, it is really meant to ease
debugging. `prefix` should be a tuple that can be packed with
`found.pack`.

### `await eavstore.create(tx, eavstore, dict)`

Store a dictionary.

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `eavstore`, save
`dict` and returns its unique identifier.

### `await eavstore.get(tx, eavstore, uid)`

Fetch a dictionary.

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `eavstore`, retrieve
the dictionary associated with `uid`. If there is no such dictionary,
returns an empty dictionary.

### `await eavstore.remove(tx, eavstore, uid)`

Clear a dictionary.

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `eavstore`, remove
the dictionary associated with `uid`.

### `await eavstore.update(tx, eavstore, uid, dict)`

Update a dictionary.

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `eavstore`, replace
the dictionary associated with `uid` with `dict`.

### `await eavstore.query(tx, eavstore, key, value)`

Lookup dictionaries according to sppecification.

In the database associated with `tx`, as part of `eavstore`, generates
unique identifier for dictionaries that have `key` equal to `value`.

## `from found import pstore`

### `pstore.PStoreException`

Exception specific to `pstore`.

### `pstore.make(name, prefix, pool)`

A handle over a `pstore` called `name` with `prefix`, that will use
`pool`.

### `await pstore.index(tx, store, docuid, counter)`

Associates `docuid` with `counter`.

Coroutine that associates the identifier `docuid` with the dict-like
`counter` inside the database associated with `tx` at `store` for
later retriaval with `pstore.search`.

`counter` must be a dict-like mapping string to integers bigger than
zero.

### `await pstore.search(tx, store, keywords, limit)`

Return a sorted list of at most `limit` documents matching `keywords`.

## `from found import vnstore`

### `vnstore.make(name, prefix, items)`

Create a handle over a `vnstore` called `name` with the prefix tuple
`prefix`, and `items` as column names.

The argument name should be a string, it is really meant to ease
debugging. prefix should be a tuple that can be packed with
found.pack. Last but not least, `items` is the columns in the returned
tuple store (or, if you prefer, the name of tuple items).

It is preferable to store the returned value.

### `await vnstore.change_create(tr, vnstore)`

Return the unique idenifier of a new change in database.  Its initial
signifiance is `None` which means it is invisible to other
transactions, and its message `None`.

### `vnstore.change_continue(tr, vsntore, changeid)`

Against transaction `tr`, and `vnstore`, continue a change `changeid`.

### `await vnstore.change_message(tr, vnstore, changeid, message)`

Replace the exisiting message of `changeid` with `message`

### `await vnstore.change_appply(tr, vnstore, changeid)`

Apply the change `changeid` against `vnstore`, setting the next
`uuid7` as significance.

#### Known issue: No serializability guarantee, because of write skew anomaly

- The historization of data introduce a risk of inexact in two steps
  intorduce a serializability problem. This can break things when
  changes are related to some group of triples: Two changes, modify
  two overllaping triples, strict ordering, serializability is not
  guaranteed, hence one transaction may write, a value based on a
  value that was overwritten by another aka. write skew anomaly.

- The use `uuid7` can break consistency, when deleting the same
  triple, and adding another, it may result in two deletion, and two
  additions, that may break the schema.

In other words, as long as we rely `uuid7` we can't consider
transaction commited with `vnstore_change_apply` happen as if all
transaction were commited on after the other, that is, there is not
serializability guarantee.

There is several ways to workaround some of those issues, they require
more code. [Contact me for more info](mailto:amirouchhe@hyper.dev).

### `await vnstore.ask(tr, vnstore, *items)`

Return `True` if `items` is alive in the space `vnstore`.

### `await vnstore.get(tr, vnstore, *items)`

TODO

### `await vnstore.remove(tr, vnstore, *items)`

Remove `items` from `vnstore`.

### `await vnstore.query(tr, vnstore, pattern, *pattern)`

Return immutable mappings where `vnstore.var` from `pattern`, and
